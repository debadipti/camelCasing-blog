                  Are you fraustrated with the Windows updates, various issues
                  and decide to try out Linux OS? But wait, which distro
                  (distribution) or which desktop environment? I suggest you to
                  try out Linux on your Windows machine with Virtualbox and
                  decide yourself which distribution you suits your needs. Below
                  are some Linux distributions from the thousands, which I
                  believe to be the best, you can try and decide.
                </p>
                <h2>1: LINUX MINT</h2>
                <p>
                  If you have never tried Linux before, Linux Mint is the first
                  one that I would recommend, because it is very popular, comes
                  with everything you need out of the box. It is very easy to
                  install with just a few steps, has great hardware & multimedia
                  support and a healthy community of excellent developers and
                  users. Linux Mint currently ranks among the top 5 distro in
                  Distrowatch. It is based on Ubuntu LTS which is pretty stable
                  for day-to-day use.
                </p>

                    src="assets/images/linux/linux-mint-cinnamon-19.1.jpeg"
                    alt="Linux Mint Cinnammon 19.1"
                    class="u-max-full-width"
                  />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Simple learning curve if you are coming straght from Windows
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Installation process is very easy with just a few click
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Very stable and supported for a long time as it is based on
                    Ubuntu LTS
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Comes preinstalled with all the essential tools and software
                    out of the box
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Security issues are patched up very quickly because of its
                    large community
                  </li>
                  <li>Great community support if you face any problem</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Linux Mint features 3 desktop environments which are Cinnamon,
                  Xfce and Mate. But, Cinnammon is like the flagship when it
                  comes to Linux Mint, and this is what I recommend. You can
                  download the ISO file (32 bit and 64 bit) from below link:

                </p>
                <h2>2: MANJARO</h2>
                <p>
                  If you have ever tried or used Linux, then I would definitely
                  recommend Manjaro which is a great distro, really popular
                  among the Linux world and currently sits on top of
                  Distrowatch. Even if you have never touched Linux, I would
                  still recommend Manjaro, because it is fairly stable and very
                  fast. The reason it is really popular because it is based on
                  Arch Linux which is a bleeding edge operating system. The
                  installation process of Arch Linux is not easy, but Manjaro
                  takes all the hassles and still features all of the
                  awesomeness of Arch Linux.
                </p>

                    src="assets/images/linux/manjaro-xfce.jpg"
                    alt="Manjaro XFCE"
                    class="u-max-full-width"
                  />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Features a stable rolling release model</li>
                  <li>Installation process is very intuitive</li>
                  <li>Security issues are patched up really quickly</li>
                  <li>Extensive configurability options</li>
                  <li>Great hardware support and always helping community</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Manjaro releases 3 different official editions of destop
                  environment along with other community editions. But, offers
                  Xfce as the core desktop environment. You can find the
                  download link below:
                </p>

                <h2>3: UBUNTU</h2>
                <p>
                  Ubuntu is widely used and often comes preinstalled on many
                  non-Windows laptops (10% worldwide Ubuntu claims). It has a
                  really stable base (Debian) and comes with everything you need
                  out of the box. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu because it has a
                  great hardware and also multimedia support. It features GNOME
                  as default desktop environment, but you can install other
                  distros (flavours) backed by Ubuntu packages and updates.
                </p>
                <p>

                    class="u-max-full-width"
                  />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Features GNOME which needs some time to get used to</li>
                  <li>Pre-loaded with all the essential applications</li>
                  <li>Great community and help guides</li>
                  <li>
                    Really stable and solid, perfect for production machine
                  </li>
                  <li>Many flavors to try and choose</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  It ships with Gnome desktop environment by default, but has 7
                  official desktop environments/flavours, as they call it. Find
                  the download links below:

                  Linux is not hard to install and use. You can install
                  Virtualbox on your Windows machine and try installing Linux.
                  If you like any of the above or other Linux Distribution, and
                  do not like the monopoly of Windows, install it on your
                  machine as your main OS. I bet you will not regret it.
